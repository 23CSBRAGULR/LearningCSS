<h1>Element Selector</h1>
<p>This is not the most efficient selector cuz it styles based on the tags</p>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="Style.css">
<h1>This is styled using the tag on the style sheet</h1>
<p>This too</p>
<hr>

<h1>Class Selectors</h1>
<p>This selector allows us to chnage different inputs's styles though they are of the same tag</p>
<p>This selector differentiates inputs using classes</p>
<p>Note: Before accessing a class Element, '.' is needed, to indicate its a class</p>
<h1 class="one">Though this and the below one are H1's</h1>
<h1 class="two">Their Colors are different, thanks to Class Selector</h1>
<hr>

<h1>ID selector</h1>
<p>This selector too achieves the achievement of Class Selectors</p>
<p>This selector differentiates inputs using ID's</p>
<p>Note: Before accessing an ID Element, '#' is needed, to indicate that its an ID</p>
<h1 id="id1">Both of</h1>
<h1 id="id2">these are H1's</h1>
<hr>

<h1>Main difference Between ID's and Classes</h1>
<p>ID's are not designed for multiple use. i.e, one ID can only be used once</p>
<p>But Classes are designed for multiple use</p>
<hr>

<h1>Universal Selector</h1>
<p>This selector styles all the remaining elements of this html sheet, at once</p>
<p>This styles everything ELSE</p>
